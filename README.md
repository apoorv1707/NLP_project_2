Combination of word embeddings for long text classification
In this project, we are using BERT along with other word embedding techniques for long texts and then training a classification model and evaluating its performance. 
We also provide some preliminary results in this project showcasing how combining vectors formed by various word embeddings can result in better accuracy for the classification model.
